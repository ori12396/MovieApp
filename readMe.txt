-------------------------Hello user-------------------
This is a readme file that will provide  you with instructions on how to use the app.
First you need to have npm installed on your computer , secondly  you need to extract my file  , then open it by writing 'npm start' (preferably via vs.code terminal) .

This is a movie app that fetches  movie data from TMDB API and reveals it for you .  

For your convenience , you have a 'navbar' that you use to navigate and handle the transition between the pages, and also show which page you currently are.
You can add a movie to your favorite by clicking on the heart icon at the right of each movie card,  and un-favorite it by the  same way.
You can also purchase a movie.  
You can watch all your purchased movies, and handle your favorite movies in the user info tab.
For each movie you can either buy it   by pressing  buy ticket and then buy now  , add it to your favorite or just watch more details like the trailer,full overview, 18+ or not (a 18+ icon will pop up ) and etc, if you press on the buynow button\image of the movie.
You can also read an extended overview of each movie by either pressing the shrinked overview on each card (it will open a modal with full overview) .
I created all styling with css without using any bootstrap or etc but only for the logo's.

I hope you will enjoy using  it  !!!
